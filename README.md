tweetGenerator

Currently does not implement tweeting features.
Paste a text into the input.txt file, and the program will generate text based on the input using a Markov Chain algorithm.
The main method calls the method to return 100 characters.

Planned Changes:
Improve output text starting point (e.g. start with words that tend to start sentences).
Automatically end output text
